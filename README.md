# Demo

Some description, read whole text before starting something. Everything is explained in the next few lines. 

First open your jupyter notebook. The data is provided in the link. Do some exploratory analysis.

After you're done with analysis, try to come up with a decent model to predict the results.

## local development 

1. Open index.md in your text editor.
2. Have fun!
